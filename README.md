 Crude Oil Prediction
</h3>


### :globe_with_meridians: Context
The price of oil, or the oil price, generally refers to the spot price of a barrel (159 liters) of benchmark crude oilâ€”a reference price for buyers and sellers of crude oil such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent Crude, Dubai Crude. 

We hypothesize that the oil price can be modeled as a weighted lagged moving average of historical oil prices. SPY index and Dollar Index are used as the macroeconomic indicators. Oil production is used as an indicator of oil supply.
