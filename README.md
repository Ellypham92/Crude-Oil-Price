 Crude Oil Prediction
</h3>


### :globe_with_meridians: Context
The price of oil, or the oil price, generally refers to the spot price of a barrel (159 liters) of benchmark crude oilâ€”a reference price for buyers and sellers of crude oil such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent Crude, Dubai Crude. We hypothesize that the oil price can be modeled as a weighted lagged moving average of historical oil prices. 
- SPY index and Dollar Index are used as the macroeconomic indicators
- Oil production is used as an indicator of oil supply

We can use it to forecast the short-term oil price which would be useful for the government and companies for planning the budget for the fiscal year.
